     Stackboard: A Smarter Way to Organize Everything You Do Online

When you're juggling tools, tabs, apps, documents, dashboards, and a never-ending flow of content, productivity tools are supposed to help.

But too often, they become just another thing to manage.

That’s why we built Stackboard. Not just another project manager, note-taker, or bookmarking tool—but a powerful digital operating system for doers.

What Is Stackboard?
Stackboard is a resource-first productivity platform. It’s designed to help you organize your tools, workflows, and links with smart features and structure—so you can focus more on doing and less on digging.

Rather than stuffing everything into documents or kanban boards, Stackboard gives you a flexible system of:

Stacks: Think of them as workspaces or categories like "Marketing", "Design Tools", or "Client Projects".

Cards: Each card represents a tool or topic—like ChatGPT, GitHub, Notion, YouTube, or your own internal systems.

Buttons: These are your links. You decide how they open, how they're organized, and whether they should be pinned for quick access.

It’s an entirely new way to launch, manage, and revisit the things you need most—built around real-world workflows.

Why Is This Better Than Bookmarks?
Traditional bookmarks are fine for casual browsing. But once you start managing 20+ tools across multiple projects, things fall apart.

Stackboard lets you:

Add context to every link

Group and structure related tools

Control how links open (new tab, custom window, auto-close, refocus, etc.)

Launch anything instantly with custom shortcuts

Pin key tools to your sidebar for one-click access

It’s like bookmarks… if they grew up and got serious about productivity.

Superpowers Included
Beyond the stack system, Stackboard gives you smart features you won’t find elsewhere:

✨ Smart Window Management: Open links in exactly the right way, every time

📌 Pinned Buttons & Sidebar Navigation: Build your own power bar for fast workflows

🧠 AI Suggestions: Get nudges like “It’s time to post on LinkedIn” or “Add this tool to your marketing stack”

🧩 Widgets & Micro Apps: News, stocks, time tracking, code editors, AI tools, and more

✅ Project Manager: Add tasks, subtasks, and resources all in one place

And yes—everything works with shortcuts. Whether you're launching a task, switching stacks, or opening a saved search—you can do it lightning fast.

Stackboard vs. Everyone Else
Stackboard is often compared to Notion, Trello, Asana, and other productivity platforms.

But here’s the key difference: those tools are built for planning. Stackboard is built for doing.

Notion is great for writing and structuring content—but messy for managing external tools and links.

Trello is good for moving cards around—but limited when it comes to smart navigation or window control.

Asana is great for team workflows—but not built for individual tool-centric work.

Stackboard combines all that with something unique: a way to manage how you access and use your actual tools, not just write about them.

Perfect for Creators, Marketers, Developers & Doers
Stackboard is already powering workflows like:

🧑‍💻 Developers organizing GitHub repos, docs, code snippets, and toolchains

📈 Marketers juggling email tools, analytics dashboards, social media platforms, and content calendars

🎥 Creators managing Canva, Clipchamp, YouTube, AI writing tools, and post-publishing workflows

🧠 Agencies running client dashboards, social channels, CRM tools, and internal wikis

Whether you're solo or part of a team, Stackboard keeps everything organized, accessible, and streamlined.
